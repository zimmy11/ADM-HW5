# **Homework 5 - USA Airport Flight Analysis**

The goal of this project is to build a Graph in order to compute the most significant features.

Then we have implemented by scratch the most important search algorithm in the Graphs, such as **Dijkstra** or **BFS**. <br>

All the data we've worked on was downloaded from the Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flashgordon/usa-airport-dataset).
